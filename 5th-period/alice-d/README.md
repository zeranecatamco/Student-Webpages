## About Me!
- Hello! My name is Alice Dazo and I am a full time Student at Mount Eden Highschool. I am a senior who has taken an interest in the subject Compsci, and here are some of my projects and what I have learn throughout the years!
## About My Project and What I have Learned!
- This is my third version of my personal website that includes with my previous projects that I have done this year. I've learn a lot about technologies and how to use different kinds of progamming languages, such as css and html. I have also learn all of the basic functionality of css; such things as loops, arrays, intergers, etc. I've manage to create multiple games and apps while using html most of the time with a group or by myself.
## What does my Website Includes?: 
- It includes a home page!
- About me page!
- About my projects!
- Where you are able to contact me

## What are my Projects? :
- Rate Your Experience:
It's an app where you are able to rate your experience. It was one of my first project, therefore it's a lot more simpler than my other projects. It has a toggle that you are able to click and unclick the stars to matched your desire rating.


- Digital Clock
This project is a little more complicated than the rating one as the time has to sychronize with the real life time.It's a Digital Clock and function as one, the time is set as the same time as California.


- Matching Game
A Matching Game!! It's a simple game however coding it was a little tricky, as the cards were shuffled every time we reset or finish the game. A way to win the game is to match all the pairs and your objective is to match all of them up in the least amount of time and moves as little as possible!! Enjoy!


- Sodoku
A very tricky game and I could say the same with the coding, as I would have needed to make three types of board according to it's difficulties. The solution to the game is to have numbers within the 9 boxes and that it doesn't interefere with the other columns or rows. Goodluck!!
