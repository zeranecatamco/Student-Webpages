      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I am from Hayward, California. I was born in Castro Valley, California on April 1st, 2008. I'm a highshool Junior from Mt. Eden High school. I decided to take AP Computer Science Principle because I got recomended to take it by my sister. Thanks to my sister, I learned so much new things about programming. I learned about key programming concepts like variables, arrays, loops, data types, binary codes and functions. I even learned how to build web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C++. Although, it was really hard to figure out things about programming, thanks to my amazing teacher, Mr. Alvarado, he showed me how in the simplest way. Thus, this class was really interesting and it help me developed as a person in programming. Outside of programming, i'm part of a wrestling team in my high school. I placed 3rd placed on league on my freshman year. I'm also part of a cross and track team. My record for the mile is 5:17 😎. Other than sports, I enjoyed hiking with family and friends, spending time with love ones, eat, and try to be a better person in general by respecting others. My top 3 favorite music artist are, The Marias, MacDemarco, and Cuco. My biggest goal right now in life is to improve on education and myself, try to get into a UC school, and to repay my family. How i'm going to accomplished these goals is by following God because, hes the only way to become succesful in everthing. † Luke 1:37 †</p>
