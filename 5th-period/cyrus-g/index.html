          <h1>The Rock, Paper, Scissors, Game</h1>
          <h2>This project was originally done on C++, but it was remade to work with HTML, CSS, and JS. It's very simple, you choose rock, paper, or scissors, and a computer randomly picks one too, and faces off against you. Click to try!</h2>

          <h2>This project was different from the first. Instead of making a game, we made an easy to use quote and poem generator that gave some very wise words. Click to try!</h2>

          <h1>The Drum Kit</h1>
          <h2>This project was a step in a complete other direction because we implemented the use of audio. We made a drum kit, so users could click buttons on their keyboard, and start listening to a few drum sounds, complete with a tambourine. Click to try!</h2>
