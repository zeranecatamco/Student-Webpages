# AP CSP Portfolio by Yorian I.

## About Me

Hello, my name is Yorian Ixcol. I am a junior in highschool and I enjoy learning new things about technology. This interest grew when I decided to Take APCSP last year and it has been one of the coolest experiences of highschool. 

## Project Overview

This portfolio project represents my learning journey throughout the year. In this project I explored  and learned the complexities of coding and gained a better appreciation for developers' skills. Thoughout the year I learned the basics of computers, including binary code and C++, and was introduced to web development languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designing with these languages quickly became one of my favorite things to do. I always found the process enjoyable. In this project I learned the process of creating things I use in my everyday life:live websites. It was entertaining and a cool new experience to learn this. 

## Portfolio Overview

This portfolio site includes the following projects, each showcasing my growing skills in programming and game development:

- **Tic Tac Toe:** A classic two-player game played on a 3×3 grid where players take turns marking Xs and Os. The goal is to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- **Memory Card Game:** A card matching game where players flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs. The game continues until all pairs are matched.

- **Connect Four:** A strategic two-player game where players take turns dropping colored coins into a 7-column grid. The first player to connect four coins in a row wins.
