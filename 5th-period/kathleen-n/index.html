      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        Hellooooo! My name is Kathleen Nanquil and I am a senior in Mt. Eden High School. This is my first year learning about computer science, so everything was completely new to me. I definitely struggled a lot, learning everything from the basics and building up skills as we moved on to more difficult topics, but I was able to do my best by collaborating with others and getting help from my classmates. There is so many different things that I learned over the year, but I think a few of the most important ones are about how the internet works, knowing how to use proper syntax when coding, finding errors in codes when debugging, and overall just being patient and attentive during the process.

        This is my To-Do List project. You can type whatever task you need to complete into the bar and click on the plus sign in order to start your list. You can add to your list by typing in more tasks and clicking on the plus button. When you have completed a task, you can click on it to cross it out.

      </div>
      <p>
        This is my Hangman game project. To play the game, pick a category from one of the given three. You can pick characters, books, or desserts. After picking a category, you will begin to guess the word by picking a letter one-by-one to spell it out. The number of letters is represented by the dashes. If you guess a correct letter, it will appear in place of one of the dashes in the proper spelling order. If you guess a wrong letter, then a body part of the man will appear. You will win when you guess all the correct letters of the word. You will lose if you guess too many wrong letters and all of the body parts of the man are drawn.

        This is my Memory Match game project. To play the game, pick a mode from one of the given three. Easy mode is 4 x 3 cards, medium mode is 4 x 4 cards, and hard mode is 4 x 5 cards. After selecting a mode, you can begin to click the cards, two at a time to create a pair. When clicking a card, the card will turn and showcase the image. If you find a pair, the two cards with stay flipped up. If you do not find a pair, the two cards will flip back down until you can find more pairs. The time will start as soon as you click your first card and your moves will also be counted.

When you are done creating your wheel, you can click the spin button and have the wheel randomly pick for you. You may reset the wheel at any time.
