    <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
    <p>When I first started coding, I knew literally nothing. One of the first things that threw me off was binary. It felt like I was learning a new language made of just 0s and 1s, and I couldn’t wrap my head around how that connected to real programs. At first, writing even a basic if-else statement felt confusing, and debugging was frustrating because I didn’t always know what I was looking for.</p>
    <p>But over time, with practice, I began to understand the concepts more and more. I got more comfortable using arrays to organize data and started seeing how loops could make code more efficient. Even though I messed up a lot, those mistakes actually helped me learn. One of the hardest parts was figuring out how to break problems down—sometimes I’d stare at a blank screen not even knowing where to start. But after practicing with different challenges and projects, I learned how to plan out my code and think logically.</p>
    <p>While I’m not the best programmer, I am very satisfied with the progress I’ve made throughout the year. I’m also very thankful for Mr. Alvarado and the wisdom he shared with us.</p>
