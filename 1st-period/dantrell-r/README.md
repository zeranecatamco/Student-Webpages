# Dantrell R
👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Dantrell R., a junior in high school with a growing passion for computer science and web development. I started my journey with C++, which gave me a strong foundation in programming logic. Over the past year, I’ve expanded into frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building interactive web projects and continually pushing myself to learn new skills as I grow as a developer.

📚 Project Overview

This portfolio project is the culmination of everything I’ve learned in computer science this school year. It features a collection of my favorite web-based projects, built using core web technologies. Throughout the process, I gained hands-on experience with responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and structuring clean, readable code. Each project helped me improve my problem-solving skills and taught me how to bring creative ideas to life on the web.
