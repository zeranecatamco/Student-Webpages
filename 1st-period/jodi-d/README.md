# Final Project Portfolio – Jodi D

## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Jodi D**, a beginner programmer from **Mt. Eden High School**. My journey with coding began in 2020, when I took a semester-long Computer Apps class in middle school. This year, I challenged myself further by taking **AP Computer Science**. Although I found the material difficult at times, I also found it incredibly rewarding. Creating these projects gave me a sense of accomplishment and joy, and each step helped build my confidence as a student developer.

## 📚 What This Project Is

This portfolio is a collection of the projects I worked on throughout the school year in AP Computer Science. It reflects not just my growth in coding, but also the skills I gained in **collaboration**, **problem-solving**, and **creative thinking**. Through these challenges, I learned how to troubleshoot bugs, support my peers, and turn ideas into functional and fun projects.

## 🧭 What's Included in My Portfolio

My portfolio site features four interactive projects:
- 🎲 **Emoji Randomizer**
- 🎨 **Color Flipper**
- 🦠 **Whack-A-Virus**
- 🧙‍♂️ **Help A Wizard Toad** (Scratch story game)

Each project showcases different skills I developed throughout the year, from basic DOM manipulation to creative storytelling and game design.

## 🛠️ Project Descriptions

### 🎲 Emoji Randomizer
A fun and simple app that randomly displays an emoji each time a button is clicked. This project helped me understand JavaScript arrays and event handling.

### 🎨 Color Flipper
This interactive tool changes the background color of the page at the click of a button. It was a great way to learn about RGB color values, CSS manipulation, and working with JavaScript functions.

### 🦠 Whack-A-Virus
Inspired by the classic Whack-a-Mole game, this project displays viruses that "pop up" for the user to click and score points. It taught me timing functions and dynamic HTML updates.

### 🧙‍♂️ Help A Wizard Toad (Scratch)
A story-based game created in **Scratch**, where the user helps a toad wizard navigate through rooms by making choices. This was a creative exploration into game design and storytelling with branching logic.
