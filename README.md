# Shreya R. – Final Project Portfolio

## 👋 About Me
Hi! I'm Shreya Rather, a student developer who has learned about design, web development, and building creative projects this year! I would like to showcase what I've learned, and this portfolio is a reflection of my growth. This year I have learned many concepts that are applicable to many languages of coding. Starting the year of with learning C++ and ending this year with learning HTML and JavaScript has challenged me in many ways, however, it has developed my understanding of computer science as well. All these projects I am about to present contain concepts Mr. Alvarado has taught us this year- including if, else statements, loops, arrays, and much more.

## 🌐 What This Site Includes
This website is a personal portfolio that contains:
- An **About Me** section introducing who I am and what I do.
- A **Project Gallery** featuring the projects I’ve built this year.

Throughout this year, I’ve learned how to:
