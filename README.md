# Francisco Diaz – Final Project Portfolio

## 👋 About Me

When I first started coding, I knew literally nothing. One of the first things that threw me off was binary. It felt like I was learning a new language made of just 0s and 1s, and I couldn’t wrap my head around how that connected to real programs. At first, writing even a basic `if-else` statement felt confusing, and debugging was frustrating because I didn’t always know what I was looking for. 

But over time, with practice, I began to understand the concepts more and more. I got more comfortable using arrays to organize data and started seeing how loops could make code more efficient. Even though I messed up a lot, those mistakes actually helped me learn. One of the hardest parts was figuring out how to break problems down—sometimes I’d stare at a blank screen not even knowing where to start. But after practicing with different challenges and projects, I learned how to plan out my code and think logically.

While I’m not the best programmer, I am very satisfied with the progress I’ve made throughout the year. I’m also very thankful for Mr. Alvarado and the wisdom he shared with us.

## 🌐 About the Project & What I Learned

This website is a personal portfolio that includes an **About Me** section introducing who I am and what I do, as well as a **Project Gallery** showcasing the projects I’ve built this year. It features a clean and modern design that reflects my personal style, and it includes fully responsive, functional links to live project demos.

Throughout the year, I’ve learned to:
- Build and style webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Debug and enhance interactive features
- Use version control with Git
- Deploy websites through GitHub Pages
