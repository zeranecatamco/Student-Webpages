Johnathan R – Developer Portfolio

👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Johnathan R, a student developer passionate about building interactive, user-friendly web applications. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and sharpening my skills in front-end and full-stack development. My goal is to create clean, responsive, and accessible digital experiences that solve real-world problems.

📚 About This Project
This portfolio represents the culmination of a year’s worth of growth and learning in web development. Throughout this project, I’ve deepened my understanding of modern web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub Pages. I also improved my ability to plan, design, and iterate on a personal website that showcases my skills, projects, and progress as a developer.

🌐 What’s in My Portfolio
My portfolio site provides a comprehensive view of who I am as a developer. It includes:

A personal introduction and developer bio

An overview of my technical skills

A showcase of featured projects

Links to my GitHub and Repository

A responsive design for various screen sizes

💼 Featured Projects
1. Slot Machine
This was the first game that was created with Kierian Bautista. It was a Slot Machine game that you were able to collect money and gamble it to earn for upgrades

2. Tic-Tac-Toe
This was the second game that I and other classmate created. Although it went down in quality I feel more proud of this game as I did put effort into it (all things concidered)

3. Portfolio Website
The very site you’re viewing! Designed and coded from scratch to serve as my main digital presence and showcase for all my work.

4. Stinky Dungeon RPG
A group project that was a Visual novel as well as a Turn based RPG. This was created wiht the help of Francis, Jalil, and Kerian.
