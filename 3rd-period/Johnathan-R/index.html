  <h2>About me</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>I didn't really know what I was getting into when I took the class, I was expecting to code but not much. Reflecting on It now I deffinetly know a lot more about Computer Science. I like coding fun games rather than actual coding for a job. It really goes to show in the gallery below.</p>
    <p>This year I learned how to code and read code of C++, html, and CSS. Not only that I learned the fudementals of coding. Learning about variables, arrays, conditional statements, loops, data types, and how to use all of them to create very fun games and websites!</p>
  </ul>
  <h1>Gallery</h1>
  <p>Here is a list of every game me and others made this year in order.</p>
  <h2>Slot Machine</h2>
  <p>This was the first game that was created with Kierian Bautista. It was a Slot Machine game that you were able to collect money and gamble it to earn for upgrades</p>

  <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
  <p>This was the second game that I and other classmate created. Although it went down in quality I feel more proud of this game as I did put effort into it (all things concidered)</p>
  <h3><a href= https://johnathan-rice.github.io/Tic-Tac_Toe/>Tic Tac Toe</a></h3>
  <h2>Stinky Dungeon RPG</h2>
  <p>A group project that was a Visual novel as well as a Turn based RPG. This was created wiht the help of Francis, Jalil, and Kerian.</p>
