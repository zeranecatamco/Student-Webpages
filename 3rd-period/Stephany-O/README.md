## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Stephany O. I’m a student developer passionate about building clean, creative, and user-focused web applications. Over the course of my learning journey, I’ve been diving into front-end and back-end technologies, strengthening my coding skills, and exploring how design and functionality come together to create a complete user experience.

## 📚 About This Project

This final portfolio project is the culmination of my work throughout the year as a student developer. It showcases the progress I’ve made in both technical and creative areas of web development. Through building this portfolio site, I’ve learned valuable lessons about responsive design, project organization, version control with GitHub, and how to present my work effectively to a broader audience.

## 🌐 Portfolio Overview

- A clean landing page with navigation to featured projects
