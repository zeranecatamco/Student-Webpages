        <textarea placeholder="My name is Guadalupe Zapata, I have a passion for doing good in school and accomplishing my goals. I want to become a doctor and attend the University of Stanford or UC Davis. I want to make my immigrant parents proud and become the american dream they so dreamt about once having themselves. I enjoy playing soccer I always use it to have fun and as a distraction from what I have going on, I have been the captain for 2 years now and will forever be grateful to be the captain on this team and conduct good leadership. I take becoming a captain as a reward rather then a flex but I dont ever want to make myself feel greater then anyone over a label because I am the exact same as the rest of them. I will contniue playing soccer till my last year of high school. I want to become someone big (not just beacsue I eat alot every class period) in life and make big goals.MY BIRTHDAY IS ON FEBRUARY 25TH 😊🤩🤩🤞😎✌👏😜. Thank you so much Mr. Mr. denilson Alvarado,you have created me a better in my skills in coding and prepared me to be more skilled within other programs and allowing me to perform individually.
