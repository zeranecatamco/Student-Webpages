    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Chloe Antonio, I am a Junior at Mt Eden Highschool. During my year of being in AP Computer Science Principles I learned a lot, from starting off learning to read binary to now coding my own website. At first, I was nervous about learning and understanding how computers actually work behind the scenes, but as the year went on, I became more confident and started to see the logic and creativity that coding involves. I’ve learned how to break down problems, test and debug code, how functions work, and more. While I prefer using C++ because it makes more sense to me, I understand that C++ has many limitations in what it can and cannot do. And also, even though I do not plan on pursuing coding of any sort in the future, I appreciate everything that I have learned this year. One of my biggest takeaways was realizing how much problem solving and patience is involved in programming, and I will continue to apply this logic and newfound problem solving skills onto real life situations.
