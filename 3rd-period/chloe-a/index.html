    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Chloe Antonio, I am a Junior at Mt Eden Highschool. During my year of being in AP Computer Science Principles I learned a lot, from starting off learning to read binary to now coding my own website. At first, I was nervous about learning and understanding how computers actually work behind the scenes, but as the year went on, I became more confident and started to see the logic and creativity that coding involves. I’ve learned how to break down problems, test and debug code, how functions work, and more. While I prefer using C++ because it makes more sense to me, I understand that C++ has many limitations in what it can and cannot do. And also, even though I do not plan on pursuing coding of any sort in the future, I appreciate everything that I have learned this year. One of my biggest takeaways was realizing how much problem solving and patience is involved in programming, and I will continue to apply this logic and newfound problem solving skills onto real life situations.

  <h2>My Projects</h2>
  <div class="project-links">
    <div class="project">
      <a href="Memory Game">Memory Card Game</a>
      <p>A memory matching game where players flip cards to find pairs. This was the first project and was a partner project. Because I had a tutorial I was able to understand the logic behind each of the steps and I was able to help my partner / get help when either of us were stuck. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <a href="Fifteen Puzzle">Fifteen Puzzle</a>
      <p>A sliding tile puzzle that challenges users to arrange numbered tiles in order. This project was the second project we did in class and was a partner project with a tutorial. I did not have a partner on this project because they did not show up to school, so it was a little more challenging not being able to ask someone why my code was not working and I ended up spending more time on this project than the last.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <a href="Cat Memes">Cat Meme Generator</a>
      <p>Generates random cat images based on emotion. This was a group project, but this was also the first project we did on codepen in which we were not allowed any tutorials or outside help. I stared at my screen for a while making this, but with the help of the group we ended up figruing out what goes where and why. I was in charge of the buttons and shuffling of the pictures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <a href="Quiz">Quiz</a>
      <p>A multiple-choice general knowledge quiz that also has 2 open ended questions. This project was my final project for the class. It took me a while to figure out how to make open ended questions, specifically around 4 or so hours. Obviosuly, I did figure it out but it was a challenge.</p>
